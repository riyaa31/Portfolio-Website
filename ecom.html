		<h3>Ecommerce website - stockUp</h3>

		<p>This is an academic project for a web developing course. It is being done by my friends and I currently. You can view the
            progress of this project on my GitHub page. 
		<br>
		<br>
        stockUp is an e-commerce website that provides monthly subscription services for their grocery shopping and delivery service. 
		As working professionals and students often are not experienced in cooking their meals, recommending and selling pre-packaged ingredients 
		attached with an online recipe will increase the company’s sales volume and also solve a common dilemma faced by customers about their 
		cravings. This website is capable of recommending products based on their declared particulars and their transactions history. In order 
		to compete with the E-commerce giants like Walmart and Amazon, providing personalized shopping experience will allow stockUp to distinguish itself 
		from a myriad of competitors. Creating an immersive virtual shopping experience is essential in acquiring and retaining customers 
         (Shakesby, 2020), and which in turns lead to sustainable revenue growth. Furthermore, there is also a huge potential 
         for upselling and recommending products. Using NLP-driven chatbot will enhance customer’s shopping experience by providing 
         real-time assistance to the customers. Additionally, the data from the conversations can be used to improve and optimize our
          services and products to our customers. For the administrator interface, the website will provide an analytic tool that 
          will process our product sales and visualize using a graphical dashboard to show the product trends on specific 
          geographical regions and sales performance on a monthly basis. These visualizations will aid us in our decision making 
          process in targeting food advertisements to specific regions of a city at a specific time.
		<br>
		<br>
		Front-end Functionality: 
		<br>
		The Bootstrap framework will be used as the base to build a responsive front-end interface that is portable to 
		different devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones). The front-end structure is divided into 2 sections: 
		customer interface and admin interface. For the customer interface, we will provide a catalogue page, an account page,
		 and a payment page. The catalogue page will be updated and displayed the correct quantities and products in real-time. 
		 The account page will allow users to sign up/sign in and update/add their contact information and password. The server
		  will handle the authentication of the user by querying the database. The payment page will display the items that the 
		  user has added and the total bill. It will also provide options for the user to increment/decrement/remove the item. 
		  We will use Stripe API to process payments and update the ledger stored in our database. For the admin interface, we 
		  will provide a dashboard, an administrator account page, and a content manager. In the performance dashboard, it will 
		  display the total number of orders and sales statistics. In the administrator account page, we will allow the 
		  administrator to add/update/delete administrator profiles. In the content manager, administrators can add/update/delete
		   the product catalogue.
